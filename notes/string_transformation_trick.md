# Solving String Transformation Problems

In many string manipulation problems, you encounter scenarios where you need to transform one string, let's call it `s`, to make it identical to another string, `t`. A common strategy to tackle such problems is not to attempt a direct transformation of `s` to `t`. Instead, the idea is to convert both strings into some common form and then compare these transformed representations.

## The Transformation Trick

The key to this approach lies in finding a suitable transformation for both strings that preserves the necessary information for comparison. Here are the general steps to follow:

1. **Identify Transformations:**
   - Analyze the types of operations allowed in the problem (e.g., insertions, deletions, substitutions).
   - Devise a way to represent these operations in a standardized manner.

2. **Transform String `s`:**
   - Apply the identified transformations to convert `s` into its transformed form.

3. **Transform String `t`:**
   - Similarly, apply the same transformations to convert `t` into its transformed form.

4. **Compare Transformed Forms:**
   - Now that both strings are in a common representation, comparing them becomes more straightforward.
   - Check if the transformed form of `s` is equal to the transformed form of `t`.

## Example

Let's consider a hypothetical problem where you are allowed only two operations: inserting a character and deleting a character. In this case, you can represent the transformations as a sequence of "+" for insertions and "-" for deletions.

### Problem Statement

Given two strings `s = "abc"` and `t = "abd"`, you can transform `s` and `t` as follows:

- Transform `s`: "+d" (insert "d" after "c")
- Transform `t`: "" (no transformation needed)

Now, both transformed forms are comparable, and you can see that `s` can be transformed into `t` by applying the sequence of operations.

## Conclusion

The key advantage of this approach is that it simplifies the comparison step by converting both strings into a common format. This can make it easier to identify patterns and relationships between the strings, leading to a more efficient and elegant solution.

Keep in mind that the specific transformations will depend on the problem's constraints and requirements. The goal is to find a representation that captures the essence of the operations needed to transform one string into another.
